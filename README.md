# Cross-resolution learning for Face Recognition

This repository contains the code relative to the paper "[Cross-resolution learning for Face Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885620300597)" by Fabio Valerio Massoli (ISTI - CNR), Fabrizio Falchi (ISTI - CNR), and Giuseppe Amato (ISTI - CNR).

It reports a new training procedure for cross-resolution robust deep neural network.
